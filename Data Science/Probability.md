	1. Addition rule (mutually exclusive event)
	2. Addition rule (non- mutual exclusive event)
	3. Multiplication rule (Independent & Dependent events)
- probability- likelihood of even occurring
- mutually exclusive event - two event ME , if they CAN'T occur at the same time
	- head and tails won't occur at the same time -> ME events
	- 1 and 6 on dice at the same time -> ME events
- non- mutually exclusive event - two event NME , if they CAN occur at the same time
	- getting king or heart  at the same time (The king can be a heart)

- Independent events - 2 r independent events, if they do not effect one another
	- Tossing a same coin again n again
		- if u toss the same coin again the P is still 1/2 for both the second time
		- rolling a dice
- Dependent events - if they affect each other 
	- Take a king card, not put it back, then take a queen card
	- queen card's P will change to 4/51 from 4/52
## Additive rule (mutually exclusive event)
- Pr(H or T) = Pr(H)+ Pr(T)
	- 1/2 + 1/2 =1  
- ex : Pr ( 1 or 5 on dice) = 1/6 +1/6 = 2/6
## Additive rule (Non - mutual exclusive event)
- P(K or heart) =P(K)+ P(heart) - P(K and heart)
	- 4/52  + 13/52 - 1/52    = 16/52
	- intersection is excluded
## Multiplication rule (Independent & Dependent events)
1. Independent event  {Tossing a coin}
	- P (H and then T) = P(H) * P(T)
		- 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4
2. Dependent Events  {King then Queen}
	- P(K and then Q)= P(K) * P(Q/K)
		- 4/52 * 4/51  =
		- Bayer's Theorem (conditional Probability)
