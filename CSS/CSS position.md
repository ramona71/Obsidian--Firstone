- four types
 ![[Pasted image 20240914205941.png]]
	 - static- default
	 - relative- relative to default position (by applying margins and shit)
	 - absolute-relative wrt to parent/website(div inside a div)
	 - fixed - fixed wrt to page
- Z index- decide which element goes on top of other
	- higher the index , the top it is
	- the default z index is 0, to push it down use -1
