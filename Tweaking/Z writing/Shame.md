life of shame
i've reached 21 and yet all i've done is nothing
i've created nothing for myself
absolutely nothing
it's all destructive habits
not a single one is constructive
everything i've achieved has been reduced to zero
i have to build everything from scratch again
from 0
so much work and so little time and so late
it's never late
as long as your alive, it's never late
