## User interface design
- Heirarchy
	- color- make them pop out from bg to highlight it(high heirarchy)
	- size- bigger ones draw the attention
	- layout- make as many short blocks as possible
	- Alignment- keep less no of alignment points
	- white space
	- design for audience
- big, bolder and square things draw out attention , use this to show heirarchy

## User Experience Design
-  ![[Pasted image 20240918000308.png]]
- give what users want and don't force your design on them
- The main pillars are
	- Simplicity - make it simple
	- Consistency - keep it consistent 
	- Reading patterns - F pattern (sometimes Z patterns)
	- All platform design- website should rearrange itself if it's on pc/ tablet/ mobile
	- Don't do dark patterns- also comes under bad user experience
