- java, python don't have pointers :(  cpp lowkey op ngl
- with pointers comes great responsibility `(*>﹏<*)′
- learn to use them correctly ho
- cpp got smart pointers too (other than raw pointers)
# Pointer
- variable
	- value is adr
	- adr can be of another variables / fxns
- why not just use that var / fxn? 
	- can't if fxn/ var is out of scope

## declaring pointers
- `variable_type *pointer name`
	- `int  *int_pt`
	- `int* int-ptr`          both r same
	- `string* string_pt {nullptr}`   ->else points to garbage 
- ALWAYS INITIALIZER POINTER TO ZERO (nullptr)!
